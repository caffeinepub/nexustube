# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Implement core video upload and feed functionality for Nexustube with branded UI.

**Planned changes:**
- Create video upload interface with file selection and progress tracking
- Implement backend storage system for videos and metadata using Motoko
- Build video feed displaying uploaded videos with thumbnail previews in grid/list layout
- Add video playback with standard controls (play, pause, seek, volume)
- Apply Nexustube branding with red (#FF0000) primary color, yellow-orange (#FFC00E) secondary color, and dark gradient background with neon vibe

**User-visible outcome:** Users can upload videos with progress feedback, browse uploaded videos in a branded feed with thumbnails, and play videos with standard playback controls in a modern neon-themed interface.
